This modular version of the script is created solely for ease of development!

Since OBS scripts are exclusively single-file, remember that all names are in the same namespace,
so if their values were changed in one module, they are also changed for all other modules.

Remember that the logic of this script implies that it is single-file!

Use build_script.py to “build” the one-file script from the modular version.

If you want to modify this variant of script, there are some tips:

1. If you are importing something from script modules, use relative imports.
    Example: `from .const import PN`

2. If you are creating new global variable, create it in `globals.py`.

3. If you are changing value of some variable from `globals.py` in another module, dont forget to use `global` statement.
