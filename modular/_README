This modular version of the script is created solely for ease of development!

Since OBS scripts are exclusively single-file, remember that all names are in the same namespace,
so if their values were changed in one module, they are also changed for all other modules.

Remember that the logic of this script implies that it is single-file!

Use build_script.py to “build” the one-file script from the modular version.


If you want to modify something in here, there are some tips for you:

1. If you are importing something from script modules, use relative imports.
    Example: `from .globals import PN`

2. Write all relative imports at the beginning of the code.
    All relative imports in the middle of the code or somewhere else except beginning
    will not be deleted while building one-file script, that will cause errors in OBS.

3. If you are creating new global variable, create it in `globals.py`.

4. If you are changing value of some variable from `globals.py` in another module,
    don't forget to use `global` statement (even if your IDE doesn't tell you to do it).
    Remember: at the end all these files will be merged in one file.

5. DO NOT import any names from `obspython` as well as DO NOT just `import obspython`.
    5.1 If you need to import `obspython` use `import obspython as obs`;
    5.2 If you need some specific names from `obspython`, use `import obspython as obs` and then `obs.some_name`;
